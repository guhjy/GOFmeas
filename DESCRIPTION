Description: A package to compute the Hosking and Wallis goodness of fit
    measure and the bivariate extension presented by Kjldsen and Prosdocimi.
    The measures are useful to quantify the goodness of fit to a set of
    possible distribution function for a sample of observations of region of
    influence. These are typically used in flood frequency analysis.
